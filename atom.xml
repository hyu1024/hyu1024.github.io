The notations and techniques of set theory are commonly used when de- scribing and implementing algorithms because the abstractions associated with sets often help to clarify and simplify algorithm design.</em></p><p>A <strong>set</strong> is a collection of distinguishable <strong>members</strong> or <strong>elements</strong>. The members are typically drawn from some larger population known as the <strong>base type</strong>. Each member of a set is either a <strong>primitive element</strong> of the base type or is a set itself. There is no concept of duplication in a set. Each value from the base type is either in the set or not in the set. For example, a set named $P$ might consist of the three integers 7, 11, and 42. In this case, $P$’s members are 7, 11, and 42, and the base type is integer.</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">P = \{7,11,42\}, \quad Q = \{5, 10\}</script><p>Symbols commonly used to express sets and their relationships:</p><ul><li>$\{1, 4\}$ <ul><li>A set composed of the members 1 and 4</li></ul></li><li>$\{x \mid x \: is \: a \: positive \: integer\}$ <ul><li>A set definition using a set former. </li><li>Example: the set of all positive integers </li></ul></li><li>$x \in P$<ul><li>x is a member of set P</li></ul></li><li>$x \notin P$<ul><li>x is not a member of set P</li></ul></li><li>$\emptyset$<ul><li>The null or empty set</li></ul></li><li>$\mid P \mid$<ul><li>Cardinality: size of set P or number of members for set P</li></ul></li><li>$P \subseteq Q, \: Q \supseteq P $<ul><li>Set P is included in set Q, set P is a subset of set Q, set Q is a superset of set P</li></ul></li><li>$P \cup Q$<ul><li>Set Union: all elements appearing in P OR Q</li></ul></li><li>$P \cap Q$<ul><li>Set Intersection: all elements appearing in P AND Q</li></ul></li><li>$P \: — Q$<ul><li>Set difference: all elements of set P NOT in set Q</li></ul></li></ul><p>A <strong>sequence</strong> is a collection of elements with an order, and which may contain duplicate-valued elements. A sequence is also sometimes called a <strong>tuple</strong> or a <strong>vector</strong>. In a sequence, there is a 0th element, a 1st element, 2nd element, and so on. I indicate a sequence by using angle brackets &lt;&gt; to enclose its elements. For example, <3, 4 4, 5,> is a sequence. Note that sequence <3, 4 5, 4,> is distinct from sequence <3, 4 4, 5,>, and both are distinct from sequence <3, 5 4,>.</3,></3,></3,></3,></p><p>A <strong>relation</strong> <em>R</em> over set <strong>S</strong> is a set of ordered pairs from <strong>S</strong>. As an example of a relation, if S is {a, b, c}, then</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\{⟨a, c⟩,\: ⟨b, c⟩,\: ⟨c, b⟩\}</script><p>is a relation, and</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\{⟨a,a⟩,\:⟨a,c⟩\: ⟨b,b⟩\: ⟨b,c⟩\: ⟨c,c⟩\}</script><p>is a different relation.</p><p>If tuple ⟨x, y⟩ is in relation R, we may use the infix notation xRy. We often use relations such as the less than operator (&lt;) on the natural numbers, which includes ordered pairs such as ⟨1, 3⟩ and ⟨2, 23⟩, but not ⟨3, 2⟩ or ⟨2, 2⟩. Rather than writing the relationship in terms of ordered pairs, we typically use an infix notation for such relations, writing 1 &lt; 3.</p><p>Define the properties of relations as follows, with R a binary relation over set S.</p><ul><li>R is <strong>reflexive</strong> if <em>aRa</em> for all $a \in S$.</li><li>R is <strong>symmetric</strong> if whenever <em>aRb</em>, then <em>bRa</em>, for all $a, b \in S$.</li><li>R is <strong>antisymmetric</strong> if whenever <em>aRb</em> and <em>bRa</em>, then a = b, for all $a, b \in S$. </li><li>R is <strong>transitive</strong> if whenever <em>aRb</em> and <em>bRc</em>, then <em>aRc</em>, for all $a, b, c \in S$.</li></ul><p>A binary relation is called a <strong>partial order</strong> if it is antisymmetric and transitive. The set on which the partial order is defined is called a <strong>partially ordered set</strong> or a <strong>poset</strong>. Elements x and y of a set are <strong>comparable</strong> under a given relation if either <em>xRy</em> or <em>yRx</em>. If every pair of distinct elements in a partial order are comparable, then the order is called a <strong>total order</strong> or <strong>linear order</strong>.</p><h3 id="Logarithms"><a href="#Logarithms" class="headerlink" title="Logarithms"></a>Logarithms</h3><p>A logarithm of base $b$ for value $y$ is the power to which $b$ is raised to get $y$. Normally,this is written as $\log_b y = x$. Thus, if $\log_b y = x$. then $b^x = y$,and $b^{\log_b y} = y$.</p><p>Logarithms have the following properties, for any positive values of m, n, and r, and any positive integers a and b.</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{aligned}& \log(nm) = \log n + \log m \\& \log(n/m) = \log n - \log m \\& \log(n^r) = r \log n \\& \log_a n = \log_b n / \log_b a \\\end{aligned}</script><p>The first two properties state that the logarithm of two numbers multiplied (or divided) can be found by adding (or subtracting) the logarithms of the two numbers.</p><h3 id="Summations-and-Recurrences"><a href="#Summations-and-Recurrences" class="headerlink" title="Summations and Recurrences"></a>Summations and Recurrences</h3><p>Most programs contain loop constructs. When analyzing running time costs for programs with loops, we need to add up the costs for each time the loop is executed. This is an example of a <strong>summation</strong>. Summations are simply the sum of costs for some function applied to a range of parameter values. Summations are typically written with the following “Sigma” notation:</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(i)</script><p>This notation indicates that we are summing the value of f(i) over some range of (integer) values. The parameter to the expression and its initial value are indicated below the $\sum$ symbol. Here, the notation $i = 1$ indicates that the parameter is $i$ and that it begins with the value 1. At the top of the $\sum$ symbol is the expression $n$. This indicates the maximum value for the parameter $i$. Thus, this notation means to sum the values of $f (i)$ as $i$ ranges across the integers from 1 through $n$. This can also be written $f(a)+f(2)+ … + f(n)$. Within a sentence, Sigma notation is typeset as $\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(i)$.</p><p>Given a summation, you often wish to replace it with an algebraic equation with the same value as the summation. This is known as a <strong>closed-form solution</strong>, and the process of replacing the summation with its closed-form solution is known as solving the summation. For example, the summation $\sum_{i = 1}^{n} 1$ is simply the expression “$1$” summed $n$ times (remember that $i$ ranges from $1$ to $n$). Because the sum of $n$ 1s is $n$, the closed-form solution is $n$. The following is a list of useful summations, along with their closed-form solutions.</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin {aligned}& \sum_{i=1}^{n} i &=&~~ \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\& \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 &=&~~ \frac{2n^3+3n^2+n}{6} = \frac{n(2n+1)(n+1)}{6} \\& \sum_{i=1}^{\log n} n &=&~~ n \log n \\& \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} a^i &=&~~ \frac{1}{1-a} ~~ for ~~ 0 < a < 1 \\& \sum_{i=0}^{n} a^i &=&~~ \frac {a^{n+1} - 1}{a-1} ~~ for ~~ a \neq 1 \\& \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a^i &=&~~ \frac {a^{n} - 1}{a-1} ~~ for ~~ a \neq 1 \\& \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{2^i} &=&~~ 1 - \frac {1}{2^n} \\& \sum_{i=0}^{n} 2^i &=&~~ 2^{n+1} - 1 \\& \sum_{i=0}^{\log n} 2^i &=&~~ 2^{\log n+1} - 1 = 2n - 1 \\& \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac {i}{2^i} &=&~~ 2 - \frac{n+2}{2^n} \\\end {aligned}</script><p>The sum of reciprocals from 1 to n, called the <strong>Harmonic Series</strong>.</p><h1 id="Arrays-and-Linked-list"><a href="#Arrays-and-Linked-list" class="headerlink" title="Arrays and Linked list"></a>Arrays and Linked list</h1><h2 id="List"><a href="#List" class="headerlink" title="List"></a>List</h2><p>We all have an intuitive understanding of what we mean by a “list.” Our first step is to define precisely what is meant so that this intuitive understanding can eventually be converted into a concrete data structure and its operations. The most important concept related to lists is that of <strong>position</strong>. In other words, we perceive that there is a first element in the list, a second element, and so on. We should view a list as embodying the mathematical concepts of a sequence, as defined above.</p><p>We define a list to be a finite, ordered sequence of data items known as <strong>elements</strong>. “Ordered” in this definition means that each element has a position in the list. (We will not use “ordered” in this context to mean that the list elements are sorted by value.) Each list element has a data type. In the simple list implemen- tations discussed in this chapter, all elements of the list have the same data type, although there is no conceptual objection to lists whose elements have differing data types if the application requires it. The operations defined as part of the list ADT do not depend on the elemental data type. For example, the list ADT can be used for lists of integers, lists of characters, lists of payroll records, even lists of lists.</p><p>A list is said to be empty when it contains no elements. The number of ele- ments currently stored is called the length of the list. The beginning of the list is called the head, the end of the list is called the tail. There might or might not be some relationship between the value of an element and its position in the list. For example, sorted lists have their elements positioned in ascending order of value, while unsorted lists have no particular relationship between element values and positions. This section will consider only unsorted lists.</p><p>When presenting the contents of a list, we use the same notation as was in- troduced for sequences above. To be consistent with Java array indexing, the first position on the list is denoted as $0$. Thus, if there are $n$ elements in the list, they are given positions $0$ through $n − 1$ as $⟨a_0, a_1, …, a_{n−1}⟩$. The subscript indicates an element’s position within the list. Using this notation, the empty list would appear as ⟨⟩.</p><p>Before selecting a list implementation, a program designer should first consider what basic operations the implementation must support. Our common intuition about lists tells us that a list should be able to grow and shrink in size as we insert and remove elements. We should be able to insert and remove elements from any- where in the list. We should be able to gain access to any element’s value, either to read it or to change it. We must be able to create and clear (or reinitialize) lists. It is also convenient to access the next or previous element from the “current” one.</p><p>An example of a list of numbers</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">⟨2, 5, 1, 8, 23, 1⟩</script><p>Ordered collection of elements</p><p>List is an ADT; list operations are:</p><ul><li>insert an entry (on a certain position) </li><li>delete an entry</li><li>access data by position</li><li>search</li><li>move around the list - concatenate two lists </li><li>sort</li><li>…</li></ul><h3 id="Different-representations-of-lists"><a href="#Different-representations-of-lists" class="headerlink" title="Different representations of lists"></a>Different representations of lists</h3><p>Depending on what operations are needed for our application, we choose from different data structures (some implement certain operations faster than the others):</p><ul><li>Arrays.</li><li>Linked lists.</li><li>Dynamic arrays.</li><li>Unrolled linked lists.</li></ul><p>A list can be iterated through as shown in the following code fragment.</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br><span class="line">29</span><br><span class="line">30</span><br><span class="line">31</span><br><span class="line">32</span><br><span class="line">33</span><br><span class="line">34</span><br><span class="line">35</span><br><span class="line">36</span><br><span class="line">37</span><br><span class="line">38</span><br><span class="line">39</span><br><span class="line">40</span><br><span class="line">41</span><br><span class="line">42</span><br><span class="line">43</span><br><span class="line">44</span><br><span class="line">45</span><br><span class="line">46</span><br><span class="line">47</span><br><span class="line">48</span><br><span class="line">49</span><br><span class="line">50</span><br><span class="line">51</span><br><span class="line">52</span><br><span class="line">53</span><br><span class="line">54</span><br><span class="line">55</span><br><span class="line">56</span><br><span class="line">57</span><br><span class="line">58</span><br><span class="line">59</span><br><span class="line">60</span><br><span class="line">61</span><br><span class="line">62</span><br><span class="line">63</span><br><span class="line">64</span><br><span class="line">65</span><br><span class="line">66</span><br><span class="line">67</span><br><span class="line">68</span><br><span class="line">69</span><br><span class="line">70</span><br><span class="line">71</span><br><span class="line">72</span><br><span class="line">73</span><br><span class="line">74</span><br><span class="line">75</span><br><span class="line">76</span><br><span class="line">77</span><br><span class="line">78</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">/**</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"> * List ADT</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"> */</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="class"><span class="keyword">interface</span> <span class="title">List</span>&lt;<span class="title">E</span>&gt; </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">/**</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">     * Remove all contents from the list, so it is once again</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">     * empty.

Note that an optional parameter is declared for the <code>AList</code> constructor. With this parameter, the user can indicate the maximum numberofelementspermittedinthelist. Ifnoparameterisgiven,thenittakesthe value <code>defaultSize</code>, which is assumed to be a suitably defined constant value.</p><p>Because each list can have a differently sized array, each list must remember its maximum permitted size. Data member <code>maxSize</code> serves this purpose. At any given time the list actually holds some number of elements that can be less than the maximum allowed by the array. This value is stored in <code>listSize</code>. Data member <code>curr</code> stores the current position. Because <code>listArray</code>, <code>maxSize</code>, <code>listSize</code>, and <code>curr</code> are all declared to be <code>private</code>, they may only be accessed by methods of Class <code>AList</code>.</p><p>Class <code>AList</code> stores the list elements in the first <code>listSize</code> contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the <code>moveToPos</code> method followed by the <code>getValue</code> method takes $\Theta(1)$ time.</p><p>Because the array-based list implementation is defined to store list elements in contiguous cells of the array, the <code>insert</code>, <code>append</code>, and <code>remove</code> methods must maintain this property. Inserting or removing elements at the tail of the list is easy, so the <code>append</code> operation takes $\Theta(1)$ time. But if we wish to insert an element at the head of the list, all elements currently in the list must shift one position toward the tail to make room, as illustrated below. This process takes $\Theta(n)$ time if there are $n$ elements already in the list. If we wish to insert at position $i$ within a list of $n$ elements, then $n − i$ elements must shift toward the tail. Removing an element from the head of the list is similar in that all remaining elements must shift toward the head by one position to fill in the gap. To remove the element at position $i$, $n − i − 1$ elements must shift toward the head. In the average case, insertion or removal requires moving half of the elements, which is $\Theta(n)$.</p><p><img src="/2020/04/05/Data-Structure/01.png" style="zoom:50%;"></p><p>Most of the other member functions for Class <code>AList</code> simply access the current list element or move the current position. Such operations all require $\Theta(n)$ time. Aside from <code>insert</code> and <code>remove</code>, the only other operations that might require more than constant time are the constructor, the destructor, and <code>clear</code>. These three member functions each make use of the system free-store operation <code>new</code>.</p><h2 id="Linked-list"><a href="#Linked-list" class="headerlink" title="Linked list"></a>Linked list</h2><p>The second traditional approach to implementing lists makes use of pointers and is usually called a <strong>linked list</strong>. The linked list uses <strong>dynamic memory allocation</strong>, that is, it allocates memory for new list elements as needed.</p><p>A linked list is made up of a series of objects, called the nodes of the list. Because a list node is a distinct object (as opposed to simply a cell in an array), it is good practice to make a separate list node class. An additional benefit to creating a list node class is that it can be reused by the linked implementations for the stack and queue data structures presented later in this chapter. The following code shows the implementation for list nodes, called the <code>Link</code> class. Objects in the <code>Link</code> class contain an <code>element</code> field to store the element value, and a <code>next</code> field to store a pointer to the next node on the list. The list built from such nodes is called a <strong>singly linked list</strong>, or a <strong>one-way list</strong>, because each list node has a single pointer to the next node on the list.</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br><span class="line">29</span><br><span class="line">30</span><br><span class="line">31</span><br><span class="line">32</span><br><span class="line">33</span><br><span class="line">34</span><br><span class="line">35</span><br><span class="line">36</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">/**</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"> * Singly linked list node</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"> */</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Link</span>&lt;<span class="title">E</span>&gt; </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">private</span> E element;        <span class="comment">// Value for this node</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">private</span> Link&lt;E&gt; next;     <span class="comment">// Pointer to next node in list</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// Constructors</span></span><br><span class="line">    Link(E it, Link&lt;E&gt; nextval) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        element = it;</span><br><span class="line">        next = nextval;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    Link(Link&lt;E&gt; nextval) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        next = nextval;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// Return next field</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function">Link&lt;E&gt; <span class="title">next</span><span class="params">()</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> next;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// Set next field</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function">Link&lt;E&gt; <span class="title">setNext</span><span class="params">(Link&lt;E&gt; nextval)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> next = nextval;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;     <span class="comment">// Return element field</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// Set element field</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function">E <span class="title">element</span><span class="params">()</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> element;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function">E <span class="title">setElement</span><span class="params">(E it)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> element = it;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The <code>Link</code> class is quite simple. There are two forms for its constructor, one with an initial element value and one without. Member functions allow the link user to get or set the <code>element</code> and <code>link</code> fields.</p><p>The following figure shows a graphical depiction for a linked list storing four integers. The value stored in a pointer variable is indicated by an arrow “pointing” to some- thing. Java uses the special symbol null for a pointer value that points nowhere, such as for the last list node’s next field. A null pointer is indicated graphically by a diagonal slash through a pointer variable’s box. The vertical line between the nodes labeled 23 and 12 in figure(a) indicates the current position (immediately to the right of this line).</p><p><img src="/2020/04/05/Data-Structure/02.png" style="zoom:50%;"></p><p>The list’s first node is accessed from a pointer named <code>head</code>. To speed access to the end of the list, and to allow the <code>append</code> method to be performed in constant time, a pointer named <code>tail</code> is also kept to the last link of the list. The position of the current element is indicated by another pointer, named <code>curr</code>. Finally, because there is no simple way to compute the length of the list simply from these three pointers, the list length must be stored explicitly, and updated by every operation that modifies the list size. The value cnt stores the length of the list.</p><p>The following code shows the definition for the linked list class, named <code>LList</code>:</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td

Column level constraints apply to a column, and table level constraints apply to the whole table.</p><p>The following constraints are commonly used in SQL:</p><ul><li>NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value</li><li>UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different</li><li>PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table</li><li>FOREIGN KEY - Uniquely identifies a row/record in another table</li><li>CHECK - Ensures that all values in a column satisfies a specific

The LMC is generally used to teach students, because it models a simple von Neumann architecture computer—which has all of the basic features of a modern computer. It can be programmed in machine code (albeit in decimal rather than binary) or assembly code.</p><p>The LMC model is based on the concept of a little man shut in a closed mail room (analogous to a computer in this scenario). At one end of the room, there are 100 mailboxes (memory), numbered 0 to 99, that can each contain a 3 digit instruction or data (ranging from 000 to 999). Furthermore, there are two mailboxes at the other end labeled INBOX and OUTBOX which are used for receiving and outputting data. In the center of the room, there is a work area containing a simple two function (addition and subtraction) calculator known as the Accumulator and a resettable counter known as the Program Counter. The Program Counter holds the address of the next instruction the Little Man will carry out. This Program Counter is normally incremented by 1 after each instruction is executed, allowing the Little Man to work through a program sequentially. Branch instructions allow iteration (loops) and conditional programming structures to be incorporated into a program. The latter is achieved by setting the Program Counter to a non-sequential memory address if a particular condition is met (typically the value stored in the accumulator being zero or positive).</p><p>As specified by the von Neumann architecture, each mailbox (signifying a unique memory location) contains both instructions and data. Care therefore needs to be taken to stop the Program Counter from reaching a memory address containing data - or the Little Man will attempt to treat it as an instruction. One can take advantage of this by writing instructions into mailboxes that are meant to be interpreted as code, to create self-modifying code. To use the LMC, the user loads data into the mailboxes and then signals the Little Man to begin execution, starting with the instruction stored at memory address zero. Resetting the Program Counter to zero effectively restarts the program, albeit in a potentially different state.</p><h3 id="Execution-cycle"><a href="#Execution-cycle" class="headerlink" title="Execution cycle"></a>Execution cycle</h3><p>To execute a program, the little man performs these steps:</p><ol><li>Check the Program Counter for the mailbox number that contains a program instruction (i.e. zero at the start of the program)</li><li>Fetch the instruction from the mailbox with that number. Each instruction contains two fields: An opcode (indicating the operation to perform) and the address field (indicating where to find the data to perform the operation on).</li><li>Increment the Program Counter (so that it contains the mailbox number of the next instruction)</li><li>Decode the instruction. If the instruction utilises data stored in another mailbox then use the address field to find the mailbox number for the data it will work on, e.g. ‘get data from mailbox 42’)</li><li>Fetch the data (from the input, accumulator, or mailbox with the address determined in step 4)</li><li>Execute the instruction based on the opcode given</li><li>Branch or store the result (in the output, accumulator, or mailbox with the address determined in step 4)</li><li>Return to the Program Counter to repeat the cycle or halt</li></ol><h3 id="Commands"><a href="#Commands" class="headerlink" title="Commands"></a>Commands</h3><p>While the LMC does reflect the actual workings of binary processors, the simplicity of decimal numbers was chosen to minimize the complexity for students who may not be comfortable working in binary / hexadecimal</p><h3 id="Instructions"><a href="#Instructions" class="headerlink" title="Instructions"></a>Instructions</h3><p>Some LMC simulators are programmed directly using 3-digit numeric instructions and some use 3-letter mnemonic codes and labels. In either case, the instruction set is deliberately very limited (<em>typically about ten instructions</em>) to simplify understanding. If the LMC uses mnemonic codes and labels then these are converted into 3-digit numeric instructions when the program is assembled.</p><p>The table below shows a typical numeric instruction set and the equivalent mnemonic codes.</p><div class="table-container"><table><thead><tr><th>Instruction</th><th>Mnemonic</th><th>MachineCode</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Load</td><td>LDA</td><td>5xx</td></tr><tr><td>Store</td><td>STA</td><td>3xx</td></tr><tr><td>Add</td><td>ADD</td><td>1xx</td></tr><tr><td>Subtract</td><td>SUB</td><td>2xx</td></tr><tr><td>Input</td><td>INP</td><td>901</td></tr><tr><td>Output</td><td>OUT</td><td>902</td></tr><tr><td>End</td><td>HLT</td><td>000</td></tr><tr><td>Branch if zero</td><td>BRZ</td><td>7xx</td></tr><tr><td>Branch if zero or positive</td><td>BRP</td><td>8xx</td></tr><tr><td>Branch always</td><td>BRA</td><td>6xx</td></tr><tr><td>Data storage</td><td>DAT</td><td>-</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="table-container"><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">Numeric code</th><th style="text-align:center">Mnemonic code</th><th style="text-align:center">Instruction</th><th style="text-align:left">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center">1xx</td><td style="text-align:center">ADD</td><td style="text-align:center">ADD</td><td style="text-align:left">Add the value stored in mailbox xx to whatever value is currently on the accumulator (calculator).Note: the contents of the mailbox are not changed, and the actions of the accumulator (calculator) are not defined for add instructions that cause sums larger than 3 digits.

Although the LMC only uses a limited set of mnemonics, the convenience of using a mnemonic for each instruction is made apparent from the assembly language of the same program shown below - the programmer is no longer required to memorize a set of anonymous numeric codes and can now program with a set of more memorable mnemonic codes. If the mnemonic is an instruction that involves a memory address (<em>either a branch instruction or loading/saving data</em>) then a label is used to name the memory address. </p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">INP</span><br><span class="line">STA FIRST</span><br><span class="line">INP</span><br><span class="line">STA SECOND</span><br><span class="line">LDA FIRST</span><br><span class="line">SUB SECOND</span><br><span class="line">OUT</span><br><span class="line">HLT</span><br><span class="line">FIRST DAT</span><br><span class="line">SECOND DAT</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="Labels"><a href="#Labels" class="headerlink" title="Labels"></a>Labels</h3><p>Without labels the programmer is required to manually calculate mailbox (<em>memory</em>) addresses. In the <strong>numeric code example</strong>, if a new instruction was to be inserted before the final HLT instruction then that HLT instruction would move from address 07 to address 08 (address labelling starts at address location 00). Suppose the user entered 600 as the first input. The instruction 308 would mean that this value would be stored at address location 08 and overwrite the 000 (HLT) instruction. Since 600 means “branch to mailbox address 00” the program, instead of halting, would get stuck in an endless loop.</p><p>To work around this difficulty, most assembly languages (<em>including the LMC</em>) combine the mnemonics with <strong>labels</strong>. A label is simply a word that is used to either name a memory address where an instruction or data is stored, or to refer to that address in an instruction.</p><p>When a program is assembled:</p><ul><li>A label to the left of an instruction mnemonic is converted to the memory address the instruction or data is stored at. i.e. <strong>loopstart INP</strong></li><li>A label to the right of an instruction mnemonic takes on the value of the memory address referred to above. i.e. <strong>BRA loopstart</strong></li><li>A label combined with a DAT statement works as a variable, it labels the memory address that the data is stored at. i.e. <strong>one DAT 1</strong> or <strong>number1 DAT</strong></li></ul><p>In the <strong>assembly language</strong> which uses mnemonics and labels, if a new instruction was inserted before the final HLT instruction then the address location labelled FIRST would now be at memory location 09 rather than 08 and the STA FIRST instruction would be converted to 309 (STA 09) rather than 308 (STA 08) when the program was assembled.</p><p>Labels are therefore used to:</p><ul><li>identify a particular instruction as a target for a BRANCH instruction.</li><li>identify a memory location as a named variable (using DAT) and optionally load data into the program at assembly time for use by the program (this use is not obvious until one considers that there is no way of adding 1 to a counter. One could ask the user to input 1 at the beginning, but it would be better to have this loaded at the time of assembly using <strong>one DAT 1</strong>)</li></ul><h4 id="Example"><a href="#Example" class="headerlink" title="Example"></a>Example</h4><p>This program will take a user input, and count down to zero.</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">     INP</span><br><span class="line">     OUT      &#x2F;&#x2F; Initialize output </span><br><span class="line">LOOP BRZ QUIT &#x2F;&#x2F; If the accumulator value is 0, jump to the memory address labeled QUIT</span><br><span class="line">     SUB ONE  &#x2F;&#x2F; Label this memory address as LOOP, The instruction will then subtract the value stored at address ONE from the accumulator</span><br><span class="line">     OUT</span><br><span class="line">     BRA LOOP &#x2F;&#x2F; Jump (unconditionally) to the memory address labeled LOOP</span><br><span class="line">QUIT HLT      &#x2F;&#x2F; Label this memory address as QUIT</span><br><span class="line">ONE  DAT 1    &#x2F;&#x2F; Store the value 1 in this memory address, and label it ONE (variable declaration)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This program will take a user input, square it, output the answer and then repeat.

Recursion is used in a variety of disciplines ranging from linguistics to logic. The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, where a function being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur.</p><h3
